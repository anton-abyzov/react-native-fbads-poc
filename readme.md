This is a POC for react-native-fbads library to make sure it works on Android and IOS with the latest version of React-Native, fbads and fbsdk.

To test it run app on Android of 27 version and click on ShowAd button.

Commands to start from the project root directory:
`npm i && npm start`
In another terminal call `react-native run-android` or `npm run android`

Problem is when you click on `Show ad` button it shows error in console:
